# Stylized-Skybox
![Unity Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-2022.3%20LTS%2B-blueviolet?logo=unity)

A Stylized skybox shader for Unity URP (2022.3.20f1) as part of my self study on shader programming. 
Some parts of the shader code could work for built-in but is untested and may require some modifications. 
Code is based on MinionsArts' Stylized skybox shader tutorial.

## Features
- Fully customizable skybox
- Procedural Day/Night cycle
    - Sunsets and sunrises
- Stars at night
- Customizable horizons
- Customizable Clouds
- Customizable Sun and Moon

## Installation
1. Clone repo or download the asset folder and load it into an unity project.
2. If you didn't use or create a skybox material, create a material with the skybox's shader.
3. Go to lighting settings, replace the current skybox material with the stylized skybox material
4. Adjust values of the skybox material to adjust how your skybox would look
