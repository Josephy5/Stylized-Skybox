# Stylized-Skybox
![Unity Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity-2022.3%20LTS%2B-blueviolet?logo=unity)

A Stylized skybox shader for Unity URP (2022.3.20f1) as part of my self study on shader programming. 
Some parts of the shader code could work for built-in but is untested and may require some modifications. 
Code is based on MinionsArts' Stylized skybox shader tutorial.

## Features
- Fully customizable skybox
- Procedural Day/Night cycle
    - Sunsets and sunrises
- Stars at night
- Customizable horizons
- Customizable Clouds
- Customizable Sun and Moon

## Installation
1. Clone repo or download the asset folder and load it into an unity project.
2. If you didn't use the provided one or had made a skybox material, create a material with the skybox's shader.
3. Go to lighting settings, replace the current skybox material with the stylized skybox material.
4. Load the noise images (the ones provided or custom one) for the clouds and/or a star background image for the stars if you want to use those features.
5. Adjust values of the skybox material to edit how your skybox looks.
